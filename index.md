# **Biography** 

I am a PhD student in the [PLSE Group](https://scs.gatech.edu/programming-languages-software-engineering) at **[Georgia Institute of Technology (GT)](https://www.gatech.edu/)** since 2021, advised by Prof. [**Vivek Sarkar** ](https://vsarkar.cc.gatech.edu/). My current research interests are **formal method (proof assistant, especially)**, **compilers** and their applications for anything.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I spent my undergraduate time at **[Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)**, major in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/).  I was advised by Prof. **[Qinxiang Cao](https://dblp.org/pid/141/1017.html)** and worked on ***compiler correctness*** and ***mathematical logic*** in the ***Coq proof assistant*** from junior to senior year. Prior to that I studied in Prof. **[Xiang Yin](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/)**'s' group and worked on ***automata theory*** for control problems during sophomore year.

I'm always open to general research collaboration. <u>Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work on the problems I listed below or your ideas together.</u>

I'm <u>open to internship</u>. Here is my **[CV](./cv/CV_ZitengYang.pdf)**.

# **Research**

My current major focus (PhD Thesis) is improving methods for **<u>compiler correctness</u>** in different angle, especially using *[formal verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification)* through *[proof assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant)*. See the detailed problems including other areas I'm investigating or interested below:

**Formal Verification & Certified Compilation (Primary & Thesis Topic)** 

- **[Ongoing] Improving the Correctness Theory of Certified Compiler**: Investigating a "missing correctness specification" of CompCert framework through both testing and formal proofs.

- **[Ongoing] Verified Linear Scan Register Allocation**: Implementing an alternative register allocation algorithm in a formally verified compiler instead of graph-coloring algorithm to reduce both compile-time complexity and verification burden.

- **[[OOPSLA'24](./papers/oopsla24/oopsla24-final.pdf)] [Improving] Verified Instruction Scheduling**: Achieved **<u>the first ever</u>** <u>fully verified</u> instruction scheduling passes in a formally verified compiler. Further exploration are into verified inter-block scheduling.  

- **Q:** How do we improve the general framework for CompCert to make a parallelizing compilation (e.g. Parallelizing loops in GCC -O3 optimization)

- **Q:** How could equality saturation be used to improve a certified compiler optimization?

- **Q:** How to implement inter-procedural optimizations in a certified compiler? Is current general framework enough?

- **Q:** How do we ensure that the formal semantics specification of C (source language) and assembly/machine language (target language) in CompCert is correct w.r.t. their language design?

  A: Testing the reference [C interpreter](https://compcert.org/doc/html/compcert.cfrontend.Cexec.html) (verified to follow the semantics) is all we need (existing work can be found). The assembly semantics is already proved to simulate the C semantics.

- **Q:** Correct-by-construction verification using proof assistant guarantees total correctness but requires heavy proof work and much harder to scale, while translation validation of compiler passes like [Alive2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3453483.3454030) is automatic, algorithm independent and works on real-world scenario, but only find false cases. Should we desire both advantages in one method?

**Parallelism & Concurrency** (secondary, trying to find good methods for important problems)

- **[Reading] Data-race problems**: Investigating possible new approaches on both static prediction and dynamic detection of data-races.
- **[Reading] GPU Programming, Cuda, OpenMP, MLIR, etc.**
- **[Reading] Program Verification with Concurrency**: concurrent separation logic, etc.

**General Theory** (only in spare time, only for pleasure)

- **Computability view of Program Verification and Analysis**: How do we establish a theory in computability view for certified programs annotated with its correctness information like [*Dafny*](https://dafny.org/), *[Viper](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html)*, [*VST-A*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3632911), etc. ? Can we prove non-trivial new theorems based on such model?



**Undergraduate Research at SJTU**

- **Compiler Correctness for Annotation Verifier** [Corresponding author is [Dr. Qinxiang Cao](https://dblp.org/pid/141/1017.html)]: 
  
  I worked on investigating correctness theory of a new idea: compiling programs annotated with verification information ([*annotation verifier*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3632911)) and using them as possible optimization hints. I proposed an extended semantic and verification framework and gave a trial on toy language/logic.
  
  After I graduated, this expedition was continued by [Hanzhi Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hEUk48QAAAAJ), [Yanning Chen](https://lightquantum.me/), etc. to go beyond toy language using my framework. Expecting some publication(s) later.
  
- **[[IFAC'20](./papers/IFAC2020/IFAC2020-Final-Full.pdf)] Formal Control Theory (Automata Theory)** [Advised by [Xiang Yin](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/)]: Investigated the supervisory control problem for timed discrete-event systems (TDES) under partial observation where time was considered as a special event of an automata.
