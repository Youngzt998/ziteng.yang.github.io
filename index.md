# **About**

I am a first-year PhD student in the [PLSE Lab](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/content/programming-languages-software-engineering) at [School of Computer Science](https://www.scs.gatech.edu/), [College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/), **[Georgia Institute of Technology (GT)](https://www.gatech.edu/)**. 

My research experience lies in ***Programming Languages (PL)*** and ***Formal Methods***. PhD program is a brand new stage of my life. I'm still exploring the various researches in PL.

During my undergraduate time at **[Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)**, major in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) ,  I was advised by **[Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/qinxiang-cao.html)** and worked on *compiler correctness* and *Modal Logic* in *Coq proof assistant* from junior to senior year . Prior to that I studied in **[Xiang Yin's](http://xiangyin.sjtu.edu.cn/)** group and worked on Automata Theory (specifically, *supervisory control* of *Discrete Event System*) during sophomore year. They are the persons who taught me a huge number of things during undergraduate life and gave me a great start of research life.

Here is my **[CV](./cv/CV_ZitengYang.pdf)**.

# **Research Projects**

**During PhD Program**

To be updated soon (or maybe a year later)





**During Undergraduate Time**

- [2020~2021] **Verification-aided Compiler Optimization** 
  - I proposed a frame verification work based on *proof assistant Coq* and gave a trial on "toy logic" for an expedition to support compiler optimization aided by verification information carried by programs 
  - This project was now continued by  [Hanzhi Liu](https://misaka.center/), an undergraduate genius student (2019~2023, expected) and an experienced programmer at SJTU, also advised by Qinxiang Cao, to implement this optimization and framework in VST's separation logic [VST = Verified Software Toolchain]
  - Further detail should be secret now
- [2019~2020] **Finite Canonical Model for Completeness Theory in Coq Based on UnifySL**: An extension from framework of infinite model for completeness theorem proof to finite model in a logic library  [*UnifySL*](https://github.com/QinxiangCao/UnifySL) for [*Coq*](https://coq.inria.fr/) proof assistant.
- [2018~2019] **Supervisor Control of Timed Discrete-Event Systems**: Investigating the supervisory control problem for timed discrete-event systems (TDES) under partial observation where time was considered as a special event.

  - "*Ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out*"

  - "*Never let yourself be diverted either by what you wish to believe or by what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed, but look only and solely at what are the facts.*"

  - "*Love is wise, hatred is foolish.*"

  

## **Current Future Plans**

## **Some Cyber-friends :)**

- I am fortunate to know [Ziteng Wang](https://wzt.me/), who share the same spell of first name, similar spell of last name, and most importantly, the research interests in Programming Languages with me.
- I shared a similar game interest with [Zhiming Xu](https://zhiming-xu.github.io/), although we seem not to share similar research interests
- [Alex Chi](https://www.skyzh.dev/) is an undergraduate student (graduate at 2022)  from the department of Computer Science at SJTU; you might be interested in his (famous, somehow) programming skills and (famous, somehow) course grades
- [xxchan](https://xxchan.github.io/about/) used to be in the same research group with me during undergraduate time. His experience (see [this blog](https://xxchan.github.io/cs/2020/09/02/intern-at-meituan.html)) in an company might be a great reference for those (in China) who are still not sure whether going academical or industrial.  





## **Cooking**

To be updated when I became a master of that ...



# **Other Facts**

## **Jokes**

- I usually mix up with "sophomore" and "semaphore" 



## **Computer Science**

- I was also admitted by the *Master of Logic* program at the University of Amsterdam. But not rich enough to enroll : ( 
  - It doesn't mean I do not love Computer Science
- I gave up the desire of stepping into game design, another totally different career life at sophomore. This is mainly because I didn't found neither a good mentor/advisor nor suitable partners and didn't make it by self-study.
  - It doesn't mean I do not love Programming Languages. Instead, I found those two things in the area of Programming Languages later! 
  - Nevertheless, I always love the world of video games and believe they are a treasure of humans.
- I have no industrial experience till now. I still regard myself as a nonprofessional programmer...
- Unlike a lot of my friends that started learning programming at a very young age, I never touched the world of programming until freshman year at SJTU.



## Life

- I was born and raised up in Chongqing, China. This is a magical city built on several mountains. You should pay a visit if you'd like to see how such thing could exist. My father comes from Hebei Province in China and worked there in a city named Zhuozhou close to Beijing for a very long time. Therefore, I was also familiar with those cities. 
- Although I lived in Shanghai for 4 years during my undergraduate life, I know nothing about Shanghai at all because I spend most of my time on campus : (
